## Not the strongest that survives

A long time ago, it was at the beginning of the 18th century, more precisely in 1809, when Charles Darwin made a statement that was formative for that time, a statement that is still valid today and will probably survive for a long time.

> It is not the strongest of the species that survives, 
nor the most intelligent. It is the one most adaptable to change.
>
> \- Charles Darwin, 1809

The statement itself has been adapted somewhat over time, but its basic message has not changed.

It lays the foundation for something else, it's part of an area in DevOps that is often simply called a mindset.

Of course, one could now claim that the mindset is not the only thing that is important in an software development life cycle (SDLC). There are principles, practices, it is important to think about harmonizing tools. Nevertheless, without the right mindset, all of this would only be a short-lived solution.

## Why IT projects fail

Gartner studies suggest that 75% of all IT projects in the USA are seen as failures by those who initiated them.

The total number of failed projects results from different areas. Project Initiation and Planning Issues, Technical and Requirements Issues, Project Management Issues and Stakeholder Management and Team Issues.

Many problems can be found especially in the latter area "Stakeholder Management and Team Issues".

### Stakeholder Management and Team Issues

If we now look at some points why this area is so problematic, the cry for something else becomes big:

- Insufficient attention to stakeholders and their needs
- Failure to manage expectations
- Lack of senior management/executive support
- Inadequate visibility of project status
- Denial adopted in preference to hard truths
- People not dedicated to project
- Project team members lack experience and do not have the required skills
- Team lacks authority or decision making ability
- Poor collaboration, communication and teamwork

> It is the same old thinking, that leads to the same old result

I don't want to claim that the above statement is mine, but I think that this describes one of the biggest problems in today's SDLC.

What I want to convey is that it is often not the tools or the technology that make a project fail. But there are other challenges in the SDLC that we will now look at.

## The Challenges

From day to day I see in many customer situations, different roles in different projects that face similar problems. I would like to share with you some of the challenges I have experienced myself.

| Topics                   | Challenges                                          |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| **Culture**              | - No "You build it, you run it" mentality<br />- Multiple barriers between departments |
| **Lack of shared tool**  | - No integration between core components<br />- Inconsistent Toolchain<br />- Continuous Integration Maturity Dashboard missing |
| **Different Objectives** | - Lack of DevOps Mindset<br />- Coordination is hard and takes enormous efforts<br />- Different Focus area |
| **Manual Activities**    | - Manual release process<br />- Irregular versioning<br />- No standardization |
| **Monitoring**           | - Dashboard views missing<br />- Lack of centralized log management<br />- No application error management<br />- Poor incident management |
| **Security**             | - Guidelines missing<br />- No security assessment<br />- No built-in security during development |
| **Environment**          | - Infrastructure provisioning takes weeks<br />- Inconsistency in Continuous Delivery<br />- No centralized user management |
| **Knowledge Gaps**       | - Documentation missing<br />- Troublesome Onshore â€“ Offshore coordination<br />- Knowledge islands<br />- Information hiding |

Now that we know some of the challenges in an SDLC, we should take a look at the idea of DevOps.

## The Idea

If you search the Internet for an explanation of what DevOps exactly means, you will find many different views. I think there is a relatively good explanation, which I have compiled for you below.

This is a high level explanation, which allows you to quickly get into conversation with the C-level management.

> DevOps is a `movement, a culture, a set of practices and tools` that encourage `close collaboration` within the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to `increase the productivity and quality of the overall system.` The core values are `customer-centric, quality-driven and fast flow` of features into production.

This summary alone already covers most of the challenges mentioned above, of course on a very abstract level.

### What's so special about DevOps?

DevOps is based on agility and agile development. But it goes at least one step further than that, it includes the complete business side and operations. Using the principles of automation, for example, it attempts to gradually level out the overheads that have been built up to that point.

What DevOps can thus accomplish, or promises is:

- Higher quality
- Faster delivery
- Lower costs
- More flexibility

So if DevOps manages to make only half of the above mentioned IT projects a success, then we should definitely invest in DevOps transitions and start sooner rather than later.

However, it should also be clearly mentioned that DevOps of course does not make sense for every project and every organization, but a lot of principles and practices from it are always applicable and bring a quick ROI for almost every project and every organization.

What can help us to take the idea of DevOps and turn the knowing challenges into opportunities?

One possibility for integration in an organization, to take the idea of DevOps and turn the knowing challenges into opportunities, is the conceptual framework C.A.L.M.S. Thereby the acronym stands for Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement and Sharing. You can read about it soon in another blog of mine.
