## Not the strongest that survives

A long time ago, it was at the beginning of the 18th century, more precisely in 1809, when Charles Darwin made a statement that was formative for that time, a statement that is still valid today and will probably survive for a long time.

> It is not the strongest of the species that survives, 
nor the most intelligent. It is the one most adaptable to change.
>
> \- Charles Darwin, 1809

The statement itself has been adapted somewhat over time, but its basic message has not changed.

It lays the foundation for something else, it's part of an area in DevOps that is often simply called a mindset.

Of course, one could now claim that the mindset is not the only thing that is important in an software development life cycle (SDLC). There are principles, practices, it is important to think about harmonizing tools. Nevertheless, without the right mindset, all of this would only be a short-lived solution.

## The same old thinking, the same old results

I would have to investigate the exact number, but I think we can say that about 2/3 of software projects fail not because of tools or techniques, but because of the engagement of the people involved.

> It is the same old thinking, that leads to the same old result

I don't want to claim that this is mine, but I think that this is one of the biggest problems in today's SDLC. Before we talk about the idea behind DevOps, we first take a detailed look at the philosophy and the challenges we face every day.

## The Challenges

From day to day I see in many customer situations, different roles in different projects that face similar problems. I would like to share with you some of the challenges I have experienced myself.

| Topics               | Challenges                                          |
|:---------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Culture              | - No "You build it, you run it" mentality \
|                      | - Multiple barriers between departments |
| Lack of shared tool  | - No integration between core components \
|                      | - Inconsistent Toolchain \
|                      | - Continuous Integration Maturity Dashboard missing |
| Different Objectives | - Lack of DevOps Mindset \
|                      | - Coordination is hard and takes enormous efforts \
|                      | - Different Focus area |
| Manual Activities    | - Manual release process \
|                      | - Irregular versioning \
|                      | - No standardization |
| Monitoring           | - Dashboard views missing \
|                      | - Lack of centralized log management \
|                      | - No application error management \
|                      | - Poor incident management |
| Security             | - Guidelines missing \
|                      | - No security assessment \
|                      | - No built-in security during development |
| Environment          | - Infrastructure provisioning takes weeks \
|                      | - Inconsistency in Continuous Delivery \
|                      | - No centralized user management |
| Knowledge Gaps       | - Documentation missing \
|                      | - Troublesome Onshore â€“ Offshore coordination \
|                      | - Knowledge islands \
|                      | - Information hiding |

Now that we know some of the challenges in an SDLC, we should take a look at the philosophy of DevOps.

## The Philosophy

DevOps is a `movement, a culture, a set of practices and tools` that encourage `close collaboration` within the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to `increase the productivity and quality of the overall system.` The core values are `customer-centric, quality-driven and fast flow` of features into production.

What can help us to take the philosophy of DevOps and turn the knowing challenges into opportunities you can read soon in another blog of mine.
