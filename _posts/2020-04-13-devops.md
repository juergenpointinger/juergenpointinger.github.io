# The Philosophy

DevOps is a `movement, a culture, a set of practices and tools` that encourage `close collaboration` within the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to `increase the productivity and quality of the overall system.` The core values are customer-centric, quality-driven and fast flow of features into production.
