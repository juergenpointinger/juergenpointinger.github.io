          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a technology and business leader with more than 25 years of experience in the IT industry, specializing in software architecture, agile methods, and digital transformation.
            Throughout my career, I've worked across sectors such as education, finance, transportation, and telecommunications&nbsp;&ndash; always with a clear focus on scalable, secure, and user-centric solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my current role as Co-CEO at <a href="https://www.untis.at" target="_blank">Untis</a>, I help shape the digital learning experiences of tomorrow.
            My work centers on translating strategic vision into sustainable, high-impact products and services&nbsp;&ndash; grounded in strong data protection, adaptability, and usability.
            I believe that in a BANI world—marked by brittleness, anxiety, nonlinearity, and incomprehensibility&nbsp;&ndash; resilience and orientation must come from empowered, learning-capable organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            My leadership style is shaped by the principles of transformational and servant leadership.
            I aim to create environments where trust, autonomy, and intrinsic motivation can flourish, and where teams are encouraged to grow beyond functional silos.
            I see organizational development not as a side effort, but as a strategic lever: aligning people, structures, and purpose is essential to building organizations that can navigate change&nbsp;&ndash; not just react to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lifelong learning plays a key role in my work.
            I actively engage with modern frameworks and thought models to keep evolving—on both a technical and human level.
            At the core of everything I do is the belief that progress happens through clarity, collaboration, and continuous reflection.
